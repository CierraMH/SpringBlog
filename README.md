# SpringBlog
To run my test please go to the "SpringBlogApplication" main class page and select play!
While looking in this class you will see a method called insertTest that will allow you to test the create, update, and delete functions for my Blog.
To run them there is a "run" method that also has the operations to read all blogs and to see a selected blog based on the "ID" in the command line.
You can also look at the database details using the "Username": cmh and "Password":password which will allow you to see the changes made in the database.
